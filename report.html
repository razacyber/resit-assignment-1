                I started web designing when I was in high school in my country, I started working with an institute. I worked many of the professionals of the field and their different methods of working. I made few web pages designs and sold them online. I carried out this task with same knowledge and pattern. The challenge was that the site should be mobile friendly, this was a new for me to apply this function without bootstrap framework, with the help of the module content I tried applying this function and succeeded. 
                
               <h1> PAGES & FUNCTIONALITY</h1>
                
                I have made five pages of my portfolio website. Every page has different content and functionality. I have made website responsive and compatible to mobile phone view. I have made a nav bar and added nav items to them in which I have put links to my pages. Every page is linked to other pages, so you can navigate to any of the five pages. I have also added a button which is linked to one of my pages. 
                
                
                <h1>  Colours & Fonts</h1>
                
                  I used dark colours and dark theme for my website to be more prominent to eyes. Some of the fonts I used by linking google font css to my website. I focused on functionality more than themes and colours. I wanted to increase some of the functionality but it didnâ€™t well, I think I have to practice more and gain more knowledge regarding the module so that I will be able to design with more professionalism.
